TODOs:
    Current to-dos:
        a) Use the new calculateScore functionality wherever scores are calcuated...
        b) Handle the end of the game in a nicer format
        c) Add in chips
        d) Add in functionality for different wagers (e.g. click on the chips to add to the wager)

    Later to-dos:
        1) Add in monetary functionality (e.g. wagers / wins & losses etc)
        2) Options for different wagers
        3) Add in Split functionality (later on...)
        4) Add some nicer CSS
        6) Fix the ace functionality in line with "official" blackjack rules... ?? maybe ??

CURRENT BUGS:
    > Turns out I'd (MAYBE...) misunderstood aces, the first is worth 11 (unless it will bust the hand, then it's worth 1...)
    > I think the ace functionality i've used technically works, but probably needs re-work in light of the above...
    > Ensure that new cards are added to the end of the current list of cards, not inbetween 2nd and 3rd...

Notes / Thinking out loud:
