TODOs:
    a) Use the new calculateScore functionality wherever scores are calcuated...
    
    1) Add in monetary functionality (e.g. wagers / wins & losses etc)
    2) Options for different wagers
    3) Add in Split functionality
    4) Add some nicer CSS
    5) Images instead of text for cards
    6) Fix the ace functionality in line with "official" blackjack rules... ?? maybe ??


Game Mechanics:
    1) Player buys chips (later)
    2) Player places a wager (later)
    3) Dealer deals cards to the player & themself (DONE!)
    4) Player plays hand (In Progress)
    5) Dealer plays their hand (In Progress)
    6) Payouts 

(4) playing mechanics...
 - If dealt a Blackjack (21 total...) 
    √) player immediately wins (1.5x wager), unless dealer also has Blackjack 
    √) If dealer also has blackjac then wager returned
 - If not dealt a blackjack, player has five options:
    √) Stand (stay as you are - play moves on to dealer)
    √) Hit (no limit on the number of cards you can hit - unless you bust!)
    √) Double down (double your wager, dealer then deals you only one more card)
    LATER) Split (if dealt two of the same cards - you can split and then effectively play each as individual hand - dealer will add one more card to each)
    √) Surrender - if you don't like your hand, can surrender the hand and get half your wager back.

CURRENT BUGS:
> Turns out I'd misunderstood aces, the first is worth 11 (unless it will bust the hand, then it's worth 1...)
> I think the ace functionality i've used technically works, but probably needs re-work in light of the above...
> Ensure that new cards are added to the end of the current list of cards, not inbetween 2nd and 3rd...

Notes:

Need to think how to better code the aces section (but at least it works for now)
