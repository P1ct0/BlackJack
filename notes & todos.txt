TODOs:
    
    Deployment (for portfolio purposes):
        1) set up environment within AWS (S3?)
        1a) set up EC2 instance to run Jenkins
        2) set up Jenkins job to run on pushes to main branch that completes security scans and then deploys automatically to 
        3) set up development branch for further developments and then pull requests to merge into main branch when ready
        4) 

    Current to-dos:
        √) Use the new calculateScore functionality wherever scores are calcuated...
        √) Tidy up the code used to determine if player has blackjack? (e.g. does initial hand = 21 is sufficient!)
        IN PROGRESS) Handle the end of the game in a nicer format
        √) Add in chips 
        e) Add in functionality for different wagers (e.g. click on the chips to add to the wager)
        f) Tidy up Bank & Pot CSS -

    Later to-dos:
        1) Add in monetary functionality (e.g. wagers / wins & losses etc)
        2) Options for different wagers
        3) Add in Split functionality (later on...)
        4) Add some nicer CSS
        6) Fix the ace functionality in line with "official" blackjack rules... ?? maybe ??

CURRENT BUGS:
    > Turns out I'd (MAYBE...) misunderstood aces, the first is worth 11 (unless it will bust the hand, then it's worth 1...)
    > I think the ace functionality i've used technically works, but probably needs re-work in light of the above...
    > Ensure that new cards are added to the end of the current list of cards, not inbetween 2nd and 3rd...

Notes / Thinking out loud:
